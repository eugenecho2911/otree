    <p>
        At the first stage you choose how many of your tokens to contribute to the group.
        The group grade is determined by the total number of tokens contributed by the members of your group.
        Contribution could be any integer from 0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the second stage you observe how many tokens each member of your group contributed.
        You then provide a score between 0 and 12 for each member of your group (including yourself).
        There will be three scores for you: two scores provided by the other members of your group and a third score that you provided for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your total individual payoff will be determined by how many tokens the group contributes and the three scores given to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this study.
